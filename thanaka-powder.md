Thanaka powder is made from the ground bark of Wood Apple trees in Myanmar (Burma). For centuries, the people of this region have used Thanaka as a cosmetic product to exfoliate the skin. I noticed it frequent usage by students while working in Thailand and thought there may be an opportunity for the product in a Western market. It was green, gluten-free, organic, and sale of the product could help support farmers in Myanmar. I brought some samples back and sought some feedback. Encouraged by the response, I found a manufacturer, attained powder and extract samples to present. I then pitched the idea to a cosmetic company, Rooted Beauty, which had been started by Grove City College students the year before. Their focus on organic products and supporting women in developing countries made it a fit. Rooted Beauty adapted the product for the American market and introduced it in Fall 2013. It can be found on their website and in Giant Eagle, Whole Foods, and HEBs throughout the U.S.
