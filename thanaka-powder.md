<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanaka">Thanaka powder</a> is made from the ground bark of Wood Apple trees in Myanmar (Burma). For centuries, the people of this region have used Thanaka mixed as a cosmetic product to exfoliate the skin. I noticed it frequent usage by students while working in Thailand and thought there may be an opportunity for the product in a Western market. It was green, gluten-free, organic, and sale of the product could help support farmers in Myanmar. I brought some samples back and sought some feedback. Encouraged by the response, I found a manufacturer, attained powder and extract samples to present. I then pitched the idea to a cosmetic company, <a href="http://www.rootedbeauty.com/">Rooted Beauty</a>, which had been started by Grove City College students the year before. Their focus on organic products and supporting women in developing countries made it a fit. Rooted Beauty adapted the product for the American market and introduced it in Fall 2013. The <a href="http://www.rootedbeauty.com/product/mpmoisturizer/">Thanaka product</a> is offered in Giant Eagles, Whole Foods, and HEBs throughout the U.S.
