Matatu Enterprises is the entry two of my friends, and I entered into the Grove City College's 2013 Business Plan Competition in the Social Enterprise category. We finished in 2nd place and awarded prize money.

Matatus are minibuses used as transportation in Uganda. Most drivers do not own a vehicle, and much of the money earned is given to the owner. The plan was to allow drivers to increase their earnings and incrementally gain ownership of a vehicle by operating as a driver for the non-profit.

Here is the plan: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/matatu_enterprises/">Matatu Enterprises</a>
