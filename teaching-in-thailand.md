I was awarded a scholarship from Grove City College to volunteer abroad for the Summer of 2012. I ended up in Chiang Mai, Thailand serving in a small school for young adults. Students came from poorer hill tribe communities in Thailand or were refugees from Myanmar (Burma). Classes I taught included English, Leadership, and Public Speaking.
