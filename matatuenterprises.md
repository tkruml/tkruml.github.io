This is the entry two of my friends and I entered into the Grove City College's 2013 Business Plan Competition in the Social Enterprise category. We finished in 2nd place and awarded prize money.

Matatus are used as a transportation service in Uganda. Many drivers do not own their own vehicles and much of their wages are taken by the owner. Our plan was to allow drivers to increase their earnings and eventually own their own vehicle by driving it for our non-profit and eventually gaining full ownership.

Here is the plan: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/matatu_enterprises/">Matatu Enterprises</a>
